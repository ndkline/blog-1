<p>Since our College is both Windows and Mac we install the Microsoft Remote Desktop tool for Mac onto all systems. Microsoft's latest edition is a welcomed change however one annoying thing happens with every update. Each user is prompted with a nice "What's New" dialog when they launch it. After doing some digging I found that this setting is actually stored in a "sandbox" container which means that each user has this setting. Essentially if you have a system with multiple users, each one of them would have to press "Don't Show this Again" to make it go away. Well I'm a big fan of automation so I developed a quick Bash Script that will place a shell script and a Launch Agent on the system that will change this setting so users do not see that popup each time it updates. Check past the break for the script.</p>

{% highlight shell %}
#!/bin/bash
# Microsoft Remote Desktop What's New
# Dialog Box Supression Script
# Joshua D. Miller - josh@psu.edu
# The Pennsylvania State University
# Make Blank Receipt to Prevent App Store Updates
/bin/mkdir /Applications/Microsoft\ Remote\ Desktop.app/Contents/_MASReceipt
/usr/bin/touch /Applications/Microsoft\ Remote\ Desktop.app/Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt
RDCDir='/Users/$USER/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.rdc.mac'
WorkDir='/Users/$USER/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.rdc.mac/Data/Library/Preferences'
BundledVersion=`/usr/bin/defaults read /Applications/Microsoft\ Remote\ Desktop.app/Contents/Info CFBundleShortVersionString`
# Create Scripts Directory if it does not exist
/bin/test -d /Library/Scripts/EDUC || /bin/mkdir /Library/Scripts/EDUC
# Create RDC Script
/bin/rm -f /Library/Scripts/EDUC/MSRDC.sh
/bin/echo '#!/bin/bash
/bin/test -d '$RDCDir' || mkdir -p '$RDCDir'
/usr/bin/defaults write '$WorkDir'/com.microsoft.rdc.mac show_whats_new_dialog -bool False
/usr/bin/defaults write '$WorkDir'/com.microsoft.rdc.mac stored_version_number -string '$BundledVersion'' > /Library/Scripts/EDUC/MSRDC.sh
# Create RDC LaunchDaemon
if [ ! -e /Library/LaunchAgents/edu.psu.educ.MSRDC.plist ]
then
	/bin/echo '<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC '-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN' 'http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd'>
<plist version='1.0'>
<dict>
	<key>Label</key>
	<string>edu.psu.educ.MSRDC</string>
	<key>ProgramArguments</key>
	<array>
		<string>/bin/sh</string>
		<string>/Library/Scripts/EDUC/MSRDC.sh</string>
	</array>
	<key>RunAtLoad</key>
	<true/>
</dict>
</plist>
	' > /Library/LaunchAgents/edu.psu.educ.MSRDC.plist
else
	/bin/echo 'LaunchAgent exists.  Creation not needed.'
fi
exit 0
{% endhighlight %}

<p>So to summarize we are creating a launch agent which will run each time a user logs in and a script that will modify the user's plist file for Microsoft Remote Desktop to suppress the "What's New" dialog box. Comments are always welcomed and if there is a better way to do this I am definitely open to it. I have also submitted a bug report to Apple about making these settings deployable via a Configuration Profile.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are deploying this with Munki remember that you will need to change the <strong><</strong> and <strong>> </strong>to <b>&lt;</b> and <strong>&gt;</strong> as you will have to escape XML.</p>
