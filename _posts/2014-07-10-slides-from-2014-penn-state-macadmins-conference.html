<p>I have uploaded the slides from the presentation that Matt Hansen and myself presented at this years MacAdmins conference at Penn State. If you have never been to this conference I highly recommend attending next year as many of the top notch Mac Admins attend this conference and deliver great content on how to manage OS X systems in an enterprise environment. For those of you who attended the presentation, Thank you for your participation in the presentation as the questions were very engaging. The recorded session should be available at the PSU Mac Admins YouTube channel located here: <a title="PSU MacAdmins Youtube Channel" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/psumacconf" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/user/psumacconf</a>.  Also be sure to follow the hash tag on twitter of the conference at <strong>#psumac</strong></p>
